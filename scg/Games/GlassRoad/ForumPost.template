Challenge Begins: Now!
Challenge Ends: <<END_DATE>>

Here is Glass Road solo challenge #<<CHALLENGE_NUMBER>>! Wow, more than three years of these now! We have an unofficial aim in these challenges -- to figure out how much the selection of buildings impacts the scores! We are testing the hypothesis of 

[user=reverendunclebastard][/user]

that ANY set of buildings will allow for scores in the 28-30 range. So far, the high scores have been pretty close to 30 (what Uwe called a "remarkable" score in the solo game):

[b]<<PREVIOUS_RESULTS>>[/b]

Will we be able to do it again?

We will all play with the base game only (no promos). We will use the same starting buildings and draw from a set lineup of buildings when more are needed. However, you will choose and shuffle your cards on your own. [b]NOTE: Only your first blind play, in which you do not know which buildings are coming up, counts for the challenge.[/b] 

Please post your scores below. It would be awesome if you wanted to include photos of your final board and rondels as well as comments on your strategy and/or how your game went, but [b]PLEASE PLACE THEM IN SPOILER BOXES!![/b]
